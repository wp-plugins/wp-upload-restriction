This plugin allows user to upload files of selected types.

== Description ==

This plugin allows user to upload files of certain types selected by the administrator. Using this plugin you may restrict users from uploading unwanted files using the WordPress file uploader. It is very simple to use.

To return back to WordPress's default selection, just deactivate the plugin.

Currently this upload restriction is applied for all users except Administrators. In future release role wise restrictions will be given.
